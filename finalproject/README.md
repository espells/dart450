\fs24 \cf3 \cb4 For my final project, I decided to make light of our newfound reliance on technology and how it has had a detrimental effect on our interpersonal skills and ability to communicate with people in our lives. The inspiration for this project came from a story my mom told me. She\'92s a mental health counselor, and her story consisted of a couple who were unable to have an argument in person; only over text did they feel comfortable voicing their opinions and issues they had with one another. They would even argue over text while in the same apartment. I thought this was ridiculous but not that shocking now that we are on our devices so much. I wanted to make a website that made fun of the fact that we are so uncomfortable having arguments and discussions with other people. \

The website functions as part therapist, part conversational bot, to help users practice having conversations pertaining to certain scenarios such as asking your roommate to do their dishes or breaking up with your partner. The site prompts the user with a message, and depending on their answer, leads them through a series of prompts and comments, and the only way to further the conversation is by responding to the computer vocally. As of today, many computer and phone applications are made for the user in mind, to be seamless and easy to use. But people aren\'92t predictable like computers, which is a factor I tried to implement into the computer\'92s personality. The computer is crass, upfront, and blunt and forces you to say things that are both degrading and humorous. To continue on in the site, the user has to respond correctly in order to get more \'93advice\'94 from the computer. The main interaction of the site is forcing the user to have an uncomfortable interaction they could encounter in their everyday life. The computer doesn\'92t respond in a way that is formal or professional, just like talking to a real person.\

Originally, the site featured navigation surrounding key presses along with a library called Vivus, one that animates .svg pathways. These were too very defining features of my site but in the end they were removed. The keypress navigation triggered a lot of the responsive voice/annyang functions, and was getting too confusing and causing too many issues in the code. The same happened with Vivus, half of the time it was successful and other times it disrupted the rest of the code. I think I was overly ambitious with this project and the usage of so many libraries. I\'92ll now go into the future knowing that more isn\'92t necessarily better when it comes to code. With this simplification, I researched more into making my code simpler and more streamlined, now that it wasn\'92t relying on the keystrokes for events. This led me to objects in js, which helped simplify the amount of functions being used, which in the end weren\'92t really necessary because the functions only contained strings. \
\
Despite my initial design not turning out in the final, I am pleased with the final project itself. I think simplifying the code was the smart decision, because now the website is easier to use and understand, from both the perspective of the programer and the user. And even though I didn\'92t use the code I had been using the past weeks fully, I was able to learn a lot and will bring the knowledge into my future web creations. }
