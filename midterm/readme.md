DART450 - Midterm Project
Project Name - don't push my buttons

  For my midterm, I wanted to create a fun an interesting experience for users based around freedom of choice. I wanted to have the users play around with good and bad themes along with their emotions. On the main pages, they are introduced to two large buttons, defined by their colors, red and green. If they are feeling hateful, the user should click the red button. If they are feeling loving, they should click to green button. Behind each button is a new page that provides the user a customized experience based on their mood.

  For the red button, the “hateful” option, the user is then brought to a new page of six different buttons, also in red. Each button has a tiny title to identify what happens when you click it. Each is an unsavory result, ranging from something as harmless as sending a glitter bomb to your enemy to as extreme as “bombing” the entire world. The idea for this came from the idea of what would you do if it were as easy as pressing a button. The button is easy to press, therefore the decisions are easier to make. I wanted to keep the buttons stylized minimally in CSS so they were recognizable and straight forward.

  But this midterm isn't all bad. For the green button, the “loving” option that the user could embrace, I wanted to develop an exercise I had done previously in this class further. Based off of poetic magnets, I wanted to create a fridge-like screen that had many different magnets displayed where the user was then encouraged to create a note, something lovely, silly, and/or playful. The user does this by clicking and dragging each individual magnet around anywhere on the page to create whatever combos they desire. Every time the pages loads, the user is greeted with an alert that they click away and the magnets are randomly scattered on the screen with every reload. This page is almost simply styled, for original word magnets were very simple, white background, black border in Times New Roman font.

  In the end, I wanted to create a minimalist interactive experience that allows the user to really decide what actions to take and really see what they are capable of when giving the opportunity to do something hateful or kind.
